## End to End Machine Learning Project
# Student Performance Prediction
### Introduction About the Data :
**The Dataset** goal is to predict `Math Score` of students (Regression Analysis). It consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows.

It has 3 numerical features : ['math_score', 'reading_score', 'writing_score']

It has 5 categorical features : ['gender', 'race_ethnicity', 'parental_level_of_education', 'lunch', 'test_preparation_course']

There are 7 independent variable.
* `gender`: sex of students -> male/female
* `race/ethnicity`: ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B, C, D, E)
* `parental_level_of_education`: parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
